## Viewership Overview

Below is a dataset of average U.S. viewership (in millions) per episode, based on data available on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Game_of_Thrones_episodes).

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```

```{r load-data}
got_episodes <- read_csv("got_viewership_melted.csv")
head(got_episodes)

```

```{r plot-viewership}
ggplot(got_episodes, aes(x = Episode, y = Viewership, color = factor(Season))) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  geom_line(aes(group = Season)) +
  labs(
    title = "Game of Thrones Viewership by Episode",
    x = "Episode Number",
    y = "Viewers (Millions)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
